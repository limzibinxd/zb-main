> ### Requirement
> To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu versions:
> - Ubuntu Oracular 24.10
> - Ubuntu Noble 24.04 (LTS)
> - Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (LTS)
> - Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)

### Introduction
Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:  
- A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
- APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
- A command line interface (CLI) client docker.

### Step 1: Add user to sudoers file (if error occurs)
```bash title="Log in as Root or Another Sudo-Enabled User"
su -
```

```bash title="Use the visudo command to safely edit the sudoers file"
visudo
```

```bash title="Find or add a line that grants zb sudo privileges"
zb ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

Save and exit the editor: Press `Ctrl+X`, then press `Y` to confirm saving, and hit `Enter`.

Type `Exit` to exit the root shell.

### Step 2: Uninstall Old Versions
Before you can install Docker Engine, you need to uninstall any conflicting packages.

```bash title="Uninstall conflicting packages"
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```

### Step 3: Set up Docker's apt repository

```bash title="Add Docker's official GPG key:"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```

```bash title="Add repository to Apt sources:"
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

### Step 4: Install the Docker packages

```bash title="Install the latest version"
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### Step 5: Verify the installation

```bash title="Verify that installation is successful by running hello-world image:"
sudo docker run hello-world
```

### Step 6: Manage Docker as a non-root user (Post-installation)
If you don't want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group.

```bash title="1. Create the docker group"
sudo groupadd docker
```

```bash title="2. Add your user to the docker group"
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

```bash title="3. Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated"
newgrp docker
```

```bash title="4. Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo"
docker run hello-world
```
