### Introduction
[OpenSSH](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/security/openssh-server/) is a powerful collection of tools for remotely controlling networked computers and transferring data between them. OpenSSH provides a server daemon and client tools to facilitate secure, encrypted, remote control and file transfer operations, effectively replacing the legacy tools.

### Step 1: Install OpenSSH
To install the OpenSSH client applications on your Ubuntu system, use this command at a terminal prompt:

```bash 
sudo apt install openssh-client
```

To install the OpenSSH server application, and related support files, use this command at a terminal prompt:

```bash 
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

### Step 2: Generate SSH keys
To generate the keys, run the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

This will generate the keys using the RSA Algorithm. At the time of this writing, the generated keys will have 3072 bits. You can modify the number of bits by using the -b option. For example, to generate keys with 4096 bits, you can use:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

During the process you will be prompted for a password. Simply hit Enter when prompted to create the key.

By default, the public key is saved in the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, while ~/.ssh/id_rsa is the private key. Now copy the id_rsa.pub file to the remote host and append it to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys by running:

```bash
ssh-copy-id username@remotehost
```
