## Introduction
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).



## Step 1: Install Docusaurus
Open a terminal inside VS Code, navigate to the folder where you want to set up the project or create a new one. Use the following command to create a new Docusaurus project.

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

Then, run the following command to my-website directory and start a local development server.

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

By default, a browser window will open at http://localhost:3000.

Congratulations! You have just created your first Docusaurus site! 

## Step 2: Start editing 
Docusaurus uses Markdown files to manage content, such as documentation, blog posts, or custom pages. After editing, you can use the command below to build and view the changes.

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```
