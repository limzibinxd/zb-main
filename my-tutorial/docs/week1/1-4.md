### Introduction
A **Dev Container** is a Docker container set up to provide a ready-to-use development environment, often used with GitHub Codespaces. The setup is stored in a `.devcontainer` folder and can be customized for a project, branch, or team needs. It includes all the necessary tools and software, saving time on setup and ensuring everyone works in the same environment. The setup can also be modified, rebuilt, and shared across projects for consistency.

### Step 1: Create a Folder for Project
In VS Code, open the terminal or use command `` Ctrl+shift+` ``, then use the command below to create a folder named `my-dev-container`and navigate to the directory.

```bash
mkdir my-dev-container
cd my-dev-container
```

### Step 2: Open Folder in Container
Hit `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open up Command Palette above, select **Show and Run Commands >** > **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...**, choose the folder created.
