After period of time of development and check on our PC, suppose now we would like to build a version running on Renesas RZ/G2L target board

First in the Qt Creator, Click on Projects on the left side,

Click on Add Kits, RZ/G2L on the upper-left

Click on build button on the lower-left corner, the generated executables would be in the folder,

Please send to RX/G2L for execution with the scp command,
