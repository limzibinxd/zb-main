## Step 1: Build Yocto Project
Within the docker container Ubutu 20.04, please build the yocto project with appended parameters `-c polulate_sdk`

```bash 
sudo MACHINE=smarc-rzg2l bitbake core-image-qt -c populate_sdk
```

## Step 2: Check Output Script
After the build of Yocto project, the output script can be used to installed on your system, which would be located at

`<work_dir>/build/tmp/deploy/sdk poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-qt-aarch64-smarc-rzg2l-toolchain-3.1.31.sh`

## Step 3: Allow Permission
