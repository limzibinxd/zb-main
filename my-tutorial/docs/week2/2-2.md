### Step 1: Start your Container Running
Containers must be running before you can enter and use them.
If it is stopped, it will not show up when running the 'docker ps' command.
After each system restart, you will need to start up your container again. You can use 'docker ps -a' if you've forgotten the name or ID of your containers.

This command will show you all your running containers

```bash
docker ps
```

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Use this command to start your container. Use the name you gave it during the "docker run" command.
You can use the 'docker ps' command to confirm it is up and running.

```bash
docker start my_container_for_20.04
docker ps
```

### Step 2: Enter Back Into Your Running Container
During the creation and setup of your container, you created a user account with the same name as your host machine.

When entering into your container, use that user account (not root). What the command 'docker exec -it /bin/bash' does it start up a command shell inside your running container.

```bash
docker exec -it my_container_for_20.04 /bin/bash
```

Since you are just running a bash shell inside your container, you can type 'exit' to leave your container.

```bash
exit
```
